# AI-Assisted Security Triage for AWS: Prowler, Bedrock and DevOps Agent
*Continuous security scanning of your AWS account with [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler), AI-generated remediation playbooks via Amazon Bedrock (Nova Lite 2), and automated incident response through AWS DevOps Agent — all surfaced in a React dashboard.*

## Overview

Most AWS security posture tooling stops at "here's a list of 5,000 findings, good luck." This demo closes the loop:

1. **Scan** — a scheduled (and on-demand) [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler) ECS Fargate task runs against your AWS account, emitting OCSF JSON and ASFF findings to S3 and Security Hub.
2. **Ingest** — an S3 event fires a Lambda that upserts every finding into DynamoDB and triages by severity.
3. **Contextualize (on demand)** — from the dashboard, one click on a finding calls **Amazon Nova Lite 2** via the Bedrock Converse API and produces a status-aware markdown playbook (Impact / Root cause / Remediation steps with CLI + CDK snippets for FAIL; hardening or review playbooks for PASS / MANUAL).
4. **Dispatch (on demand)** — one click publishes the finding to SNS. A HMAC-SHA256-signing Lambda forwards it to your [AWS DevOps Agent](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-agent/) webhook with the Bedrock playbook embedded, so the agent starts its investigation with a remediation proposal in hand. Flip the `autoInvestigate` CDK context to `true` to fan out automatically on every CRITICAL/HIGH finding instead.
5. **Explore** — a React/Cloudscape dashboard (CloudFront + S3 + Cognito) lets you browse findings, read the AI playbook, stream the agent's investigation journal in real time, trigger scans on-demand, bulk-dispatch or bulk-generate insights for groups of findings, and suppress false positives with a reason stored in DynamoDB.

In addition, the dashboard ships a **⌘K command palette**, URL-synced filters, keyboard shortcuts, a dedicated **Investigations page** listing every DevOps Agent task dispatched from the demo, and copy-paste-ready **seeded DevOps Agent Skills** (AWS Security Remediator + Compliance Framework Translator) that line up 1:1 with the agent's Create skill form (Name, Description, Agent Type, Instructions). A **CloudWatch dashboard** is auto-provisioned as part of the deploy to surface Lambda / Bedrock / DynamoDB / Fargate health in one pane.

## At a Glance

## Architecture

![Architecture Overview](docs/architecture-overview.drawio.svg)

Five stages, all inside the customer AWS account:

- **Scan** — an ECS Fargate Prowler task runs on a schedule or on demand, writing OCSF JSON findings to S3 and ASFF findings to Security Hub (via the `-S` flag).
- **Ingest** — an S3 ObjectCreated event triggers the `ingest-findings` Lambda, which parses OCSF and upserts every finding into DynamoDB, indexed by severity and status for fast dashboard queries.
- **Contextualize** — on demand from the dashboard, the `remediation-context` Lambda calls Amazon Bedrock Nova Lite 2 via the Converse API and produces a status-aware markdown playbook (Impact, Root cause, Remediation steps with bash and CDK v2 snippets for FAIL; hardening or review playbooks for PASS / MANUAL).
- **Dispatch** — clicking _Investigate_ publishes the finding to SNS, which triggers an HMAC-SHA256-signing Lambda that POSTs the incident (with the Bedrock playbook embedded) to the AWS DevOps Agent webhook. The dashboard then polls the agent's backlog tasks and journal records back through SigV4 so you can watch the investigation in real time.
- **Explore** — a React/Cloudscape dashboard (CloudFront + S3 + OAC) authenticates via Cognito User Pool + Identity Pool and calls an IAM-authenticated Lambda Function URL over SigV4. Six pages: Dashboard, Findings, Finding Detail, Compliance, Cost, Investigations. Scan history is enumerated from S3 `raw-reports/{scan_id}/` prefixes (the authoritative audit trail — the DynamoDB table is overwritten each scan).

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed architecture, including the VPC design, IAM roles, the cost-events subsystem, and the full bi-directional DevOps Agent integration.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI ≥ 2.34.21** with credentials + default region configured
- **Node.js 20+** and **npm**
- **Python 3.12+** (for Lambda packaging inspection; not required at runtime)
- **zip** utility
- **CDK bootstrap** for the target account/region. If you haven't bootstrapped yet:
  ```bash
  npx cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>
  ```
- **Bedrock model access** — enable **Amazon Nova Lite 2** in your region via the Bedrock console (Model access > Manage model access). The demo defaults to the global inference profile `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`, which routes to the closest supported region automatically; the base model must be enabled in the regions the profile covers (the console lets you enable them in one click).
- **AWS DevOps Agent** is available in `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, and `eu-west-1`. If your infrastructure region is different, set `DEVOPS_AGENT_REGION` before deploying.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-genai-ops-demos.git
cd sample-aws-genai-ops-demos/security/prowler-security-findings-agent

# Optional overrides
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
export DEVOPS_AGENT_REGION=eu-west-1
# Bedrock model ID defaults to the Nova Lite 2 global inference profile
# (global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0), which routes to the closest supported
# region automatically. Override only if you want a specific model or an
# on-demand (non-profile) ID.
# export BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0

# Deploy
bash deploy-all.sh          # macOS / Linux
./deploy-all.ps1            # Windows / PowerShell
```

The script walks through:

1. Prerequisites check (region, CDK, AWS CLI version, zip)
2. **Interactive DevOps Agent setup** — creates the Agent Space + IAM roles, prompts you to generate a webhook URL and secret in the DevOps Agent console, then captures them and live-patches both Lambdas (trigger + dashboard-api) with the webhook URL, HMAC secret, and Space ID
3. Deploys 7 CDK stacks (everything except frontend): Data, Auth, DevOpsAgent, Scanner, Ingest, Api, Observability
4. Builds the Prowler container image via CodeBuild and pushes to ECR
5. Rebuilds the React dashboard with the CDK outputs baked in
6. Deploys the frontend stack (CloudFront + S3 + OAC)
7. Creates a default Cognito user so the dashboard is immediately usable

At the end you get the CloudFront dashboard URL and the demo login credentials printed to the console.

### Demo login

The deploy script provisions a default Cognito user for the dashboard:

- **Username**: `demo@prowler-security.local`
- **Password**: `ProwlerDemo2026!`

The email address is a synthetic non-routable value (Cognito sends no verification email because `--message-action SUPPRESS` is used). Override by exporting `DEMO_USERNAME` / `DEMO_PASSWORD` before running `deploy-all.sh`, or `$env:DEMO_USERNAME` / `$env:DEMO_PASSWORD` before `deploy-all.ps1`. The password must satisfy the Cognito policy (minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase, one lowercase, and one digit).

To create additional users after deployment, use:

```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --user-pool-id <USER_POOL_ID> \
  --username you@example.com \
  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=you@example.com \
  --message-action SUPPRESS --no-cli-pager

aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \
  --user-pool-id <USER_POOL_ID> \
  --username you@example.com \
  --password 'YourPass123!' \
  --permanent --no-cli-pager
```

### Trigger your first scan

1. Open the dashboard URL and sign in.
2. On **Dashboard**, click **Run scan now**. The Fargate task starts; first-time pulls of the Prowler image take ~90s.
3. Findings arrive in 3-10 minutes depending on account size.
4. Open **Findings** → click any CRITICAL/HIGH item → press **Generate AI Insights** to produce the Bedrock-generated playbook on demand (shown in the Overview tab).
5. From the same finding, press **Investigate with DevOps Agent** to dispatch a single incident to the Agent. The Investigation tab streams backlog task status and journal records live; the Agent Operator console shows the full reasoning trace.

## CDK Stacks

All stack IDs include the region suffix for multi-region deployments.

| Stack | Purpose | Key Resources |
|---|---|---|
| `ProwlerSecurityData-{region}` | State | DynamoDB `prowler-security-findings` (PK `finding_uid`, GSIs `severity-index` + `status-index`), S3 raw-reports + remediations buckets |
| `ProwlerSecurityAuth-{region}` | Auth | Cognito User Pool + Identity Pool + authenticated IAM role |
| `ProwlerSecurityDevOpsAgent-{region}` | Agent webhook | SNS topic, HMAC-SHA256 Lambda, Secrets Manager secret |
| `ProwlerSecurityScanner-{region}` | Prowler | ECR repo, CodeBuild image build, ECS cluster + Fargate Task Definition (SecurityAudit + ViewOnlyAccess), EventBridge schedule |
| `ProwlerSecurityIngest-{region}` | Pipeline | `ingest-findings` Lambda (S3-triggered), `remediation-context` Lambda (Bedrock Converse / Nova Lite 2) |
| `ProwlerSecurityApi-{region}` | Dashboard API | `dashboard-api` Lambda with IAM-auth Function URL (SigV4 from browser). Routes findings, scans, cost events, investigations, suppressions, insights |
| `ProwlerSecurityObservability-{region}` | Metrics | CloudWatch Dashboard stitching Lambda invocations, Bedrock tokens, DynamoDB RCU/WCU, and Fargate scan runs into one pane |
| `ProwlerSecurityFrontend-{region}` | Dashboard | CloudFront + S3 website + OAC |

## How it maps to other demos in this repo

This demo was built to slot cleanly next to the existing patterns:

- **DevOps Agent webhook** (`cdk/lib/devops-agent-stack.ts` + `cdk/lambda/devops-agent-trigger/index.py`) is an adaptation of [`observability/eks-investigation-devops-agent`](../../observability/eks-investigation-devops-agent/), replacing CloudWatch-alarm payloads with Prowler OCSF findings.
- **React/Cloudscape dashboard** follows [`operations-automation/ai-lambda-runtime-migration`](../../operations-automation/ai-lambda-runtime-migration/): Cognito User Pool → Identity Pool → SigV4 → IAM-authorized Lambda Function URL (instead of AgentCore Runtime).
- **Shared tooling**: `shared/scripts/check-prerequisites.sh` and `shared/utils/aws-utils.sh` are used verbatim for region detection and prereq validation.

## Cost

All costs approximate, `us-east-1` pricing.

### Idle (~$1/day)

| Resource | Note | $/month |
|---|---|---|
| DynamoDB | On-demand | ~$0.25 |
| S3 | <1 GB total | <$0.10 |
| CloudFront + Cognito | Minimal traffic | ~$1 |
| ECR image | 1 GB image stored | ~$0.10 |
| Secrets Manager | 1 secret | $0.40 |

### Per scan (~$0.50 + Bedrock usage)

- Fargate task: 1 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, ~5 min runtime → ~$0.02
- **Nova Lite 2 remediation** (Converse API, 1 call per finding you click "Generate AI Insights" on): ~$0.0002–0.001 per finding depending on OCSF size
- CodeBuild: only runs on image rebuilds

### DevOps Agent usage

Per the [DevOps Agent pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/devops-agent/pricing/) — charged per investigation hour. The webhook simply enqueues incidents; cost depends on how much the agent actually investigates.

## Cleanup

```bash
bash scripts/cleanup.sh        # macOS / Linux
./scripts/cleanup.ps1          # Windows
```

Destroys all 8 stacks in reverse dependency order and (after confirmation) deletes the DevOps Agent Space and its IAM roles.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `The provided model identifier is invalid` or `isn't supported` when calling Converse | Model access not enabled in the inference-profile regions | Enable Nova Lite 2 in Bedrock console > Model access > Manage across the regions the selected profile covers (the `global.*` profile spans all supported regions — the console has a one-click enable). |
| CodeBuild fails to pull `toniblyx/prowler` | Docker Hub rate limits | Re-run `bash scripts/build-scanner-image.sh`; or switch to an ECR Public mirror in `scanner/Dockerfile`. |
| Fargate task fails with `AccessDenied` on S3 | Bucket region mismatch | Confirm `RawReportsBucket` is in the same region as the scanner task; rerun `deploy-all.sh`. |
| DevOps Agent never receives incidents | Webhook URL/secret still placeholders | Run `bash scripts/setup-devops-agent.sh` — it live-updates the deployed Lambda and Secrets Manager. |
| Dashboard returns 403 calling the API | Authenticated role missing `lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl` | Redeploy `ProwlerSecurityApi-{region}` and `ProwlerSecurityAuth-{region}`. |
| Investigations tab shows "Space ID not set" after a `cdk deploy` | CDK context lost when deploying without `-c devOpsAgentSpaceId=...` (CDK rewrote the Lambda env var to `""`) | Re-run `bash scripts/setup-devops-agent.sh` to live-patch the dashboard-api + trigger Lambdas, or always pass the `-c devOpsAgent*` flags to `cdk deploy`. |
| `SSM parameter /cdk-bootstrap/... not found` | CDK not bootstrapped | `npx cdk bootstrap aws://<account>/<region>` once. |

## Design decisions

### Why direct Converse (Nova Lite 2) instead of AgentCore Runtimes?

The [`ai-lambda-runtime-migration`](../../operations-automation/ai-lambda-runtime-migration/) demo is the canonical example of multi-step AgentCore Runtimes. Here, the "agent" loop is already provided by AWS DevOps Agent itself — Bedrock's role is a single contextualization step per finding. A Converse API call with a constrained system prompt is the cheaper, lower-latency option.

### Why a Lambda Function URL (not API Gateway)?

Same reason the runtime-migration demo does not have API Gateway: fewer moving parts, lower idle cost, and direct SigV4 auth against IAM using credentials the Identity Pool already mints for the browser.

### Why ECS Fargate for Prowler (not Lambda)?

Prowler scans a medium-sized account in 3–10 minutes — too long for Lambda's 15-minute hard limit when scanning multiple regions, and awkward to package with its dependencies. Fargate runs the official `toniblyx/prowler` image as-is.
