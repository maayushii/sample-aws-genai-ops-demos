# Architecture — Prowler + DevOps Agent + Bedrock Nova Lite

## Goals

1. Run Prowler against the deployed AWS account on a schedule and on-demand from the UI.
2. Persist findings in a queryable, dashboard-ready store.
3. For the findings that matter (CRITICAL / HIGH / failing), produce an AI-generated remediation playbook with Amazon Bedrock Nova Lite 2, and feed it into AWS DevOps Agent so the investigation starts with concrete next steps.
4. Expose the whole thing as a modern single-page dashboard.

## Detailed view

The detailed diagram adds what the overview omits:

- All 7 CDK stacks mapped to their resources (Scanner, Ingest + AI Remediation, Dispatch, Cost events, Dashboard), plus the outer AWS Cloud boundary and the nested VPC with its 2 public subnets.
- Both directions of the DevOps Agent integration: the outbound HMAC-SHA256 webhook dispatch and the inbound SigV4 `aidevops` REST poll used by the Investigations tab.
- The IAM roles that each Lambda and the Fargate task assume, with their key permissions inline.
- The cost-events subsystem: every billable action (Bedrock Converse, DevOps Agent dispatch, Fargate scan) writes one row to a dedicated DynamoDB table surfaced on the Cost page.
- Security Hub as an external destination that receives ASFF findings via Prowler's `-S` flag.

The editable source is at [`architecture.drawio`](architecture.drawio). Both SVGs are draw.io exports with the source diagram embedded (`File > Export as > SVG… > Include a copy of my diagram`), so they are round-trip editable — open the `.svg` directly in draw.io to edit.

## Authentication & authorization

- Admin creates users in Cognito (no self-sign-up). Users sign in with email + password.
- The browser exchanges the User Pool ID token for temporary AWS credentials via the Identity Pool.
- Every API call is SigV4-signed against the Lambda Function URL (IAM auth).
- The authenticated IAM role only grants `lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl`. All DynamoDB / S3 / ECS access happens server-side through the `dashboard-api` Lambda's role.

## Data model

DynamoDB `prowler-security-findings` (one item per finding):

| Attribute | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `finding_uid` (PK) | S | Prowler's stable hash of check_id + resource_uid |
| `scan_id` | S | Timestamp of the scan that produced this snapshot |
| `severity` | S | CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO |
| `status` | S | FAIL / PASS / MANUAL |
| `check_id`, `check_title`, `check_description`, `status_extended` | S | Prowler metadata |
| `service_name`, `resource_uid`, `region`, `account_id` | S | Subject of the finding |
| `compliance_frameworks` | L<S> | CIS / PCI / NIST / etc. inferred from OCSF unmapped.compliance |
| `last_seen_at` | S | ISO8601 of latest scan that reported this UID |
| `raw` | S | Truncated OCSF JSON (<350 KB) for forensics in the detail page |
| `remediation_s3_key`, `remediation_generated_at`, `remediation_model` | S | Present only for CRITICAL/HIGH after Bedrock generates a playbook |

Secondary indexes: `severity-index` (PK severity, SK last_seen_at) and `status-index` (PK status, SK severity) support the dashboard's most common queries without scanning.

## Prowler execution

- Official `toniblyx/prowler` image (built once into ECR by the CodeBuild project).
- Task role: `SecurityAudit` + `ViewOnlyAccess` managed policies plus a small `ProwlerExtras` statement for the permissions Prowler needs that aren't in those two (credential report generation, service last accessed, etc.).
- Command: `prowler aws --output-formats json-ocsf csv html -S` — `-S` additionally sends ASFF to Security Hub so findings are queryable there too.
- The entrypoint uploads `{account}.ocsf.json` (and human-readable csv/html) to `s3://raw-reports/raw-reports/{scan_id}/`.

## Bedrock prompt

System prompt fixes the playbook to three sections: **Impact**, **Root cause**, **Remediation steps** with bash and TypeScript (CDK v2) snippets. Temperature 0.2, max tokens 1500.

The user message includes the key OCSF fields (severity, check id, description, resource, service, region, compliance frameworks) plus the first 8 KB of raw OCSF. Truncation is intentional — the model needs context but the check title + description usually tell it everything.

## DevOps Agent payload

The HMAC-signed POST body schema matches what the EKS demo uses (eventType/incidentId/priority/title/description), but:

- `incidentId` is `prowler-{finding_uid}` so the agent deduplicates if the same finding reappears.
- `description` embeds the Bedrock markdown when available (up to 20 KB).
- `data.remediationS3Key` is passed so the agent can fetch the full markdown directly if needed.

## Extending this demo

Ideas intentionally **out of scope** for the first version:

- **Multi-account scans** — Prowler supports `--role-arn` to assume a role per account. Extend the task definition env to accept an array of target accounts and loop.
- **Autonomous remediation** — today Bedrock only *describes* the fix. Wiring an additional AgentCore Runtime with action groups that actually apply the fix (behind an approval gate) is the natural phase 2.
- **Continuous drift detection** — rather than daily cron, use Config Rules as the trigger, scan only the changed resource, and update the single DynamoDB item.
