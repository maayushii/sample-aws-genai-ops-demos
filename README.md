# AWS GenAI for Operations Demos

This repository contains deployable code samples demonstrating how generative AI drives operational excellence across security, cost optimization, resilience, and automation. Each demo provides working implementations that solve real operational challenges - deploy as-is with one click, or adapt to your specific environment and business needs with minimal customization effort.
