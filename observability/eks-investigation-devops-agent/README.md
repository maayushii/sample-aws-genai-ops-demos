# Intelligent EKS Incident Investigation with AWS DevOps Agent
*Automatically detect, investigate, and diagnose EKS infrastructure incidents using AWS DevOps Agent — reducing mean time to resolution from hours to minutes*

## Overview

When a microservice running on EKS fails, on-call engineers spend 30–60 minutes manually checking pods, logs, database connectivity, and security groups before identifying the root cause. This demo deploys a 3-service payment platform on Amazon EKS, wires CloudWatch alarms to the AWS DevOps Agent, and lets you inject real incidents to watch the agent investigate automatically.

The demo includes a **DevOps Agent Lab** — a built-in control center for injecting failures, managing agent skills, viewing investigation logs, and monitoring account usage. No manual investigation required.

## At a Glance

## Architecture

![Architecture Overview](docs/architecture-overview.drawio.svg)

The platform has three layers:

- **Application Layer** — CloudFront serves the React portal from S3 and routes API traffic through an NLB to three microservices running on EKS (Merchant Gateway, Payment Processor, Webhook Service), backed by RDS PostgreSQL and SQS for async webhook delivery.
- **Observability & Incident Response** — Fluent Bit ships container logs to CloudWatch. Metric filters trigger alarms that flow through SNS → Lambda (HMAC-signed) → AWS DevOps Agent, which automatically investigates pods, logs, RDS connectivity, and security groups to deliver a root cause analysis.
- **CI/CD Pipeline** — CodeBuild builds container images from S3 source bundles into ECR. AWS CDK (9 stacks) provisions all infrastructure, and Kustomize manages Kubernetes manifests per environment.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture documentation including network design, security model, and data flows.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI v2.34.21+** with configured credentials and default region
- kubectl v1.31+
- Node.js 20+ with npm
- `zip` utility
- Git
- **CDK bootstrap** — the target account + region must be bootstrapped before running the deploy script. If you've never deployed CDK to this account/region pair, run:
  ```bash
  npx cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>
  ```
  Bootstrapping creates the IAM roles, S3 bucket, ECR repo, and SSM parameter that CDK uses to publish assets and assume deploy roles. It's a one-time, idempotent operation per account/region. Without it, the deploy fails on the first stack with `SSM parameter /cdk-bootstrap/hnb659fds/version not found`.

No local Docker or Java required — container images are built in the cloud via AWS CodeBuild.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-aws-genai-ops-demos.git
cd sample-aws-genai-ops-demos/observability/eks-investigation-devops-agent
```

### 2. Deploy

> **⚠️ Interactive step required during deployment:** The script will pause and ask you to generate a DevOps Agent webhook from the AWS console. Have a browser ready — the script prints the exact console URL to open.

> **Two regions, set them both.** The deploy uses two independent region variables:
>
> - `AWS_REGION` — where the CDK stacks (EKS, RDS, CloudFront, etc.) are deployed. If unset, the AWS CLI falls back to `aws configure get region`, which may not be what you want.
> - `DEVOPS_AGENT_REGION` — where the DevOps Agent Space is created. Defaults to `us-east-1` because `AWS::DevOpsAgent` resources are not available in every region.
>
> For a same-region deployment (example: Ireland):
> ```bash
> # Bash
> export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
> export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
> export DEVOPS_AGENT_REGION=eu-west-1
> bash deploy-all.sh
> ```
> ```powershell
> # PowerShell
> $env:AWS_REGION = "eu-west-1"
> $env:AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = "eu-west-1"
> $env:DEVOPS_AGENT_REGION = "eu-west-1"
> .\deploy-all.ps1
> ```

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash deploy-all.sh

# Windows / PowerShell
.\deploy-all.ps1
```

The deployment script:
1. Creates the DevOps Agent Space, IAM roles, Operator Access, and account association (in the DevOps Agent region)
2. Prompts for the webhook URL and secret (generated in the DevOps Agent console)
3. Deploys 9 CDK stacks (EKS, RDS, CloudFront, monitoring, etc.) in current region
4. Builds 3 container images via CodeBuild
5. Applies Kubernetes manifests and seeds the database
6. Builds and deploys the React frontend

Total: ~25 minutes.

## How the Incident Detection Works

```
Payment Processor crashes (wrong DB password)
        │
        ▼
Fluent Bit ships error logs → CloudWatch Logs
        │
        ▼
Metric Filter detects "database connection" errors
        │
        ▼
CloudWatch Alarm triggers (threshold breached)
        │
        ▼
SNS Topic notifies Lambda function
        │
        ▼
Lambda signs payload with HMAC-SHA256 → calls DevOps Agent webhook
        │
        ▼
DevOps Agent investigates: pods, logs, RDS, security groups
        │
        ▼
Root cause analysis + remediation steps delivered
```

No human intervention needed between the crash and the diagnosis.

## DevOps Agent Lab

The Lab is a built-in demo control center accessible via the 🧪 icon in the portal (lower right hand corner). It's powered by a separate Lambda-based API (outside the EKS cluster) that uses kubectl to inject and rollback failures.

**How it works:**
- A Lambda function in VPC runs kubectl commands against the EKS cluster via a kubectl Lambda layer
- EKS authentication uses STS presigned URLs (same mechanism as `aws eks get-token`)
- API Gateway exposes routes for inject, rollback, status, usage, and investigation logs
- CloudFront routes `/admin/*` requests to the API Gateway
- DynamoDB stores scenario timers for server-side auto-revert (10 minutes)
- The Lambda calls the DevOps Agent API (SigV4-signed, cross-region) for usage and investigation data

**Why Lambda outside the cluster:** If we put the simulator inside EKS, a DNS failure scenario would kill the simulator too. The Lambda is isolated from cluster failures.

**Lab sections:**

| Section | API Endpoint | Data Source |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 🔥 Scenarios | `POST/DELETE /admin/scenarios/{id}/inject` | kubectl → EKS |
| Status cards | `GET /admin/status` | kubectl + CloudWatch |
| 🧠 Skills | N/A (copy-paste to Operator Access) | Static content in UI |
| 📋 Logs | `GET /admin/logs` | DevOps Agent API (list-backlog-tasks, list-executions, list-journal-records) |
| 📊 Usage | `GET /admin/usage` | DevOps Agent API (get-account-usage) |

## Run the Demo

Here is a suggested demonstration workflow:

### 1. Verify the platform

Open the Portal URL, log in with `demo-merchant-1` / `DemoPass2026!`, browse the catalog, and authorize a payment. This proves the platform is healthy before the incident.

### 2. Open the DevOps Agent Lab

Click the 🧪 lab icon in the bottom-right corner of the portal. The Lab has four sections:

- **🔥 Scenarios** — inject real infrastructure failures
- **🧠 Skills** — create a custom skill to teach the agent your business context
- **📋 Logs** — view recent investigations with metrics (tool calls, skills loaded, duration)
- **📊 Usage** — monitor DevOps Agent account usage and estimated cost

### 3. Inject a failure (automated investigation)

Pick a scenario and click **Inject**:

| Scenario | What Breaks | How the Agent Finds It |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Database Connection Failure** | Wrong DB password → CrashLoopBackOff | Reads pod logs, traces to credential mismatch |
| **DNS Resolution Failure** | CoreDNS scaled to 0 → all DNS fails | Traces from app errors across namespaces to kube-system |

Wait ~2 minutes for the CloudWatch alarm to fire. The agent starts investigating automatically.

### 4. Watch the investigation

Open the DevOps Agent Operator Access (link in the Lab UI) to watch the agent:
- Check pod status and read container logs
- Inspect RDS database connectivity
- Review security groups and recent changes
- Deliver a root cause analysis with remediation steps

The Lab's **Logs** section shows a compact summary of each investigation with metrics.

### 5. Demo the Skills feature

This demonstrates how custom skills add business context the agent can't discover from infrastructure alone. The demo includes a ready-made skill that teaches the agent about the Helios commerce platform — revenue figures, SLA budgets, merchant tiers, and PCI-DSS requirements — so it can format investigation findings into executive-ready incident reports.

1. In the Lab's **Skills** section, expand the skill card
2. Copy-paste the fields into the Operator Access Skills page (3 clicks)
3. Open **Chat** in Operator Access and ask: *"Users are reporting slowness on the Helios commerce platform, can you investigate and format a proper report?"*
4. The agent produces an executive-ready report with:
   - Revenue impact (€1,667/min based on €2.4M/day)
   - SLA budget tracking (21.6 min/month)
   - Severity classification (P1/P2/P3/SECURITY)
   - PCI-DSS compliance assessment
   - Merchant-specific impact analysis

Without the skill, the agent reports technical findings only. With the skill, it adds business context, SLA tracking, and compliance assessment.

### 6. Demo the Kiro Power for DevOps Agent

This demonstrates how a developer can leverage the DevOps Agent directly from their IDE to review architecture, map topology, and understand dependencies before making changes — the daily workflow, not just emergency incident response. No need to switch to the AWS console or Operator Access.

**Setup** (one-time): Install the AWS DevOps Agent Power in Kiro:

[![Add to Kiro](https://kiro.dev/images/add-to-kiro.svg)](https://kiro.dev/launch/powers/aws-devops-agent)

**The demo prompt** — open Kiro in this project and ask:

> *"I'm new to this project. Can you map the Helios payment platform topology — what's running on EKS, what databases and queues it uses, how traffic flows from CloudFront to the backend, and flag anything that looks unhealthy?"*

The Power will:
1. Discover the Agent Space and trigger an investigation
2. Stream findings in real-time as the agent maps the topology: EKS services, RDS PostgreSQL, security groups, CloudFront distribution, NLB routing
3. Deliver a complete architecture overview with health status — all inside Kiro

**Why this matters:** The developer has the CDK stacks, Kubernetes manifests, and service code open in their editor. The Power bridges local workspace knowledge with the agent's live AWS discovery. This is the daily workflow — understanding your architecture before making changes — not just emergency incident response.

**Follow-up prompts to try:**
- *"Before I change the RDS instance type, what depends on the database and are there any active alarms?"*
- *"What's the blast radius if I modify the EKS node security group?"*
- *"The payment-processor pods are in CrashLoopBackOff — can you investigate? Here's what I see in the logs..."* (after injecting a failure from the Lab)

### 7. Rollback

Click **Rollback** on the scenario card, or wait for the auto-revert timer (10 minutes).

## Cost Estimate

All costs approximate, based on `us-east-1` pricing.

### Running Cost (~$6.50/day)

| Resource | Specification | $/month |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| EKS Cluster | Control plane | $73 |
| EC2 Instances | 2× t4g.medium (Graviton) | $40 |
| NAT Gateway | 1 gateway + data processing | $32 |
| CloudWatch | Log groups, metrics, alarms | $15 |
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.t3.micro, single-AZ | $14 |
| DevOps Agent | Investigation hours ($29.88/hr) | ~$5 (demo usage) |
| CloudFront + S3 + ECR + Secrets | Minimal demo traffic | ~$8 |

### Cost Optimization

- **Graviton (ARM64)**: Default architecture saves ~20% on EC2 vs x86
- **Single NAT Gateway**: 1 instead of 2 to reduce cost
- **Single-AZ RDS**: No Multi-AZ standby (demo only)
- **Tear down when not in use**: `.\scripts\cleanup.ps1` deletes everything

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Pods stuck in **Pending** | Nodes scaled to 0 | Scale up: `aws eks update-nodegroup-config --cluster-name devops-agent-eks-dev-cluster --nodegroup-name $(aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name devops-agent-eks-dev-cluster --query 'nodegroups[0]' --output text) --scaling-config desiredSize=2,minSize=1,maxSize=5` |
| **504** Gateway Timeout | Backend pods not running | Check: `kubectl get pods -n payment-demo` |
| **500** on payment | DB credential mismatch | Check logs: `kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=payment-processor -n payment-demo --tail=50` |
| CloudFront returns **403** | S3/OAC misconfigured | Re-run deployment |
| Agent Space not found | CLI too old | Upgrade AWS CLI to >= 2.34.21 |
| Investigation shows "no AWS account access" | Missing association | Re-run `.\scripts\setup-devops-agent.ps1` |
| CDK fails with **`SSM parameter /cdk-bootstrap/hnb659fds/version not found`** | Account/region is not CDK-bootstrapped | Run `npx cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>` once, then re-run `deploy-all.sh` |
| CDK bootstrap "S3 bucket already exists" | Broken CDK bootstrap stack | Run `npx cdk bootstrap --force` or delete the orphaned S3 bucket `cdk-hnb659fds-assets-*` and re-bootstrap. See [CDK bootstrap troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping-troubleshoot.html) |
| Deploy targeted the wrong region | `AWS_REGION` unset, so CLI fell back to `aws configure get region` | `export AWS_REGION=<intended-region>` and `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<same>` before running the script |
| CodeBuild fails in **DOWNLOAD_SOURCE** with `BucketRegionError` (builds fail in ~18s) | The CodeBuild sources S3 bucket (`devops-agent-eks-cfn-templates-<account>`) exists in a different region than this deploy, left over from a previous attempt. CodeBuild cannot pull sources cross-region. | Delete the misplaced bucket and re-run: `aws s3 rm s3://devops-agent-eks-cfn-templates-<account> --recursive --region <old-region>` then `aws s3 rb s3://devops-agent-eks-cfn-templates-<account> --region <old-region>`. The deploy script now detects this upfront. |

## Recreating the Agent Space

To start fresh with a clean Agent Space (e.g., for A/B testing skills):

```powershell
# Delete the old space
aws devops-agent delete-agent-space --agent-space-id <space-id> --region us-east-1

# Re-run setup — creates new space, prompts for webhook, updates deployed Lambdas
.\scripts\setup-devops-agent.ps1          # PowerShell
bash scripts/setup-devops-agent.sh        # Bash
```

The setup script detects the deployed demo and live-updates Lambda env vars and Secrets Manager — no CDK redeploy needed.

## Cleanup

```bash
bash scripts/cleanup.sh              # Bash
.\scripts\cleanup.ps1                # PowerShell
```

The cleanup script deletes all resources in reverse dependency order: CloudFormation stacks, ECR images, EKS kubectl-managed resources, RDS instance, S3 buckets, Secrets Manager secrets, CloudWatch log groups, DevOps Agent Space, and IAM roles.
